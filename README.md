- 👋 Hi, I’m @Modulor79
- 👀 I’m interested in computational architecture and implementations of AI in generative design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dynamo, rhino/grasshopper-galapagos, python and once I'm a bit comfortable with those, tensorflow and openCV 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have to do with spatial and architectural analysis in lines with information 3D modelling.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at ?
